Subject: URGENT - Payment processed but account still shows unpaid

Dear Support Team,

I am extremely frustrated with your billing system. I processed a payment of $1,250 on January 10th for my annual subscription, but my account dashboard still shows "Payment Overdue" with a red warning banner.

This is completely unacceptable. I have the bank confirmation showing the payment went through (Transaction ID: TXN-789456123), yet your system hasn't updated. This is causing disruption to my business operations as I cannot access premium features I've already paid for.

I demand this issue be resolved immediately. If this is not fixed within 24 hours, I will be forced to escalate this to my legal team and consider switching to a competitor.

This is the third time I've had billing issues with your company. Your payment processing system is clearly broken and this incompetence is costing me money.

I expect a prompt response and immediate resolution.
